# AirBnb-StoryTelling

INTRODUCTION

For the past few months, Airbnb has seen a major decline in revenue. Now that the restrictions have started lifting and people have started to travel more, Airbnb wants to make sure that it is fully prepared for this change.

OBJECTIVE

A study to find out relations among various parameters like location; average review rates; price etc. for the AirBnB stays. We need to be able to tell stories to two groups - Data Analysts / Lead Analysts and Head of Acquisitions and Operations / Head of User Experience
